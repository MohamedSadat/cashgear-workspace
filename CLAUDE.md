# Cash Gear Workspace

A Notion-style workspace for the Cash Gear ecosystem: block documents, a page tree, databases,
embedded sheets and ERP data, in the browser and as a Tauri desktop app.

Status: Phase 0 (scaffold and spikes) is done; the next step is Phase 1. Spike results and the
decisions they changed are in `docs/DECISIONS.md` (2026-11-11: Phase 0 results).

## Workflow

The same rules cashgear-sheet works by.

1. **Read first.** `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (the phase you are on), `docs/PROGRESS.md`,
   `docs/DECISIONS.md`. The design is in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/DATA_MODEL.md`,
   `docs/SYNC_DESIGN.md` and `docs/INTEGRATIONS.md`.
2. **One phase at a time.** Ask all of the phase's questions in one batch, recommended option
   first. Wait for the answers. Log them with the date in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.
3. **Small choices:** make them and log them under "Defaults picked". **Expensive to reverse:**
   stop and ask.
4. **`main` only.** Commit and push to `main`. No branches, no worktrees, no pull requests. Small
   Conventional Commits scoped by package or crate (`feat(editor): …`, `fix(store): …`,
   `docs: …`). Every commit builds and passes the standing checks.
5. **End of a phase.** Record evidence for each exit criterion in `docs/PROGRESS.md`. Commit,
   push, tag `phase-N`. From Phase 1 also: a `CHANGELOG.md` section, one version bumped
   everywhere, tag `v0.N.0`. Report, then show a card that starts the next phase in a new
   session.
6. **Keep the documents true.** A design that changes is updated in the same phase.

## Hard limits

- Nothing shipped under GPL, AGPL, LGPL, SSPL or BUSL.
- The editor never saves, loads or calls the network. The workspace layer never looks inside a
  document.
- A client never drops document content it does not understand; an older client opens a newer
  document read-only.
- Block ids never change and are never minted in response to a remote change.
- Schema content expressions use `*` only. New attributes are optional with defaults. No node or
  attribute is ever removed or renamed.
- The API process loads no Yjs library.
- No ERP data in a document, a local store or a Workspace table. No ERP API key anywhere.
- No credential in `localStorage`, in a file, or in the repo.
- Nothing is reachable without a session or a share link a person created. Blob containers are
  private.
- Permissions are decided on the server. Hiding a control is never the check.
- Missing generic components are built in `CashGear.React.UI` and used by bumping its pinned
  commit.
- Other repos (`CashGear.React.UI`, `cashgear-sheet`, the ERP) are changed only as an agreed
  track, never as a side effect of work here.

## Layout

What exists. Packages planned for later phases are in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `apps/web` (`@cgw/web`) | Vite + React entry: picks the platform (web or Tauri) and mounts the shell |
| `packages/shell` (`@cgw/shell`) | App frame (sidebar, top bar, hash routing by page id), i18next catalogues (`en`, `ar`), theme controller, command registry, `event.code` shortcuts, the `WorkspacePlatform` interface |
| `scripts/eslint` | Workspace's own lint rules: `cgw/no-untranslated-text` |
| `apps/desktop` (`@cgw/desktop`, crate `cgw-desktop`) | Tauri 2 shell showing the same page; CSP in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` |
| `scripts/` | Standing-check runner, licence gate, third-party notices, desktop smoke test, WebView2 setup |
| `tests/e2e` | Playwright specs (Chrome and Edge) |
| `tests/license-gate` | GPL fixtures the licence self-test must reject |
| `crates/cgw-ydoc` | Yjs functions over `yrs` for the server worker (merge, diff, compact, JSON, text, client ranges, validate), with a C ABI for .NET; build the DLL with `--profile ffi` |
| `bench/editor` (`@cgw/bench-editor`) | Phase 0's editor model (schema, block-id plugin, Yjs seam, vendored id-aware binding) and its harnesses: S1 fuzz, S2 gate, S3 corpus, browser checklist, budgets, hostile content |
| `bench/ydoc-dotnet`, `bench/sequence-dotnet` | .NET 10 harnesses: `cgw-ydoc` by P/Invoke (S3); 50 writers on SQL Server (S8) |
| `bench/webview2-host` (crate `cgw-webview2-host`) | A WebView2 window on any URL, driven by Playwright over CDP |
| `bench/sheet-embed` | Sheet's deployed app in a sandboxed iframe (S9) |
| `bench/results/` | What runs write; not committed; CI uploads it |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Licence gates on Ubuntu; build, test, desktop smoke and the Phase 0 harnesses on Windows |
| `docs/` | Plan, design, decisions, progress |

## Commands

| Command | What |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm check` | Every standing check below, in CI's order; stops at the first failure (`--no-rust` skips Rust) |
| `pnpm format:check` / `pnpm format` | Prettier |
| `pnpm lint` | ESLint, zero warnings |
| `pnpm typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` in every package |
| `pnpm test` | Vitest unit tests |
| `pnpm rust:fmt` / `pnpm rust:clippy` / `pnpm rust:test` | `cargo fmt --check`, `clippy -D warnings`, `cargo test` over the workspace |
| `pnpm deny` | `cargo deny check licenses sources` |
| `pnpm licenses:check` / `pnpm licenses:selftest` | npm licence gate, and proof that both gates reject a GPL dependency |
| `pnpm build` | Web build and third-party notices |
| `pnpm test:e2e` | Playwright against `pnpm preview` (port 4273) |
| `pnpm desktop:build` / `pnpm desktop:smoke` | Release desktop build (`target/release/cgw-desktop.exe`), then WebView2 smoke over CDP |
| `pnpm dev:web` / `pnpm dev:desktop` | Vite dev server on port 5273; Tauri dev window on it |
| `pnpm bench:s3` | S3: Yjs writes a corpus, `cgw-ydoc` processes it from .NET, Yjs checks it (`S3_DOCS`, `S3_BIG_BYTES`) |
| `pnpm bench:webview2-host` then `pnpm bench:browser [-- --s5 --s6 --s7 --chrome --webview2]` | Browser harnesses on port 4290 |
| `pnpm bench:sequence` | S8 on LocalDB (creates and drops `cgw_spike_s8`) |
| `pnpm bench:sheet-embed` | S9 against Sheet's deployed app |
| `S1_OPS=10000 S1_SEEDS=3 S1_COMPARE=1 pnpm exec vitest run bench/editor/src/s1-fuzz.test.ts` | The full S1 fuzz, with the rejected configurations for comparison |

## Related repos on this machine

| Repo | Path | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cash Gear Sheet | `D:\CashGear\Projects\cashgear-sheet` | Template for tooling, Tauri shell, CI, docs; embed partner (Track S) |
| Shared UI | `D:\CashGear\Projects\CashGear.React.UI` | `@cashgear/ui`, pinned by commit (Track U) |
| Cash Gear ERP | `D:\CashGear\Projects\CashGear` | UnifiedAPI; connect contract (Track E). Its settings point at a live shared database: read only, run nothing |
| ERP React client | `D:\CashGear\Projects\ERPClient_React` | Where ERP link and connect flows start |

`D:\CashGear\Projects\CashGearUI` is legacy WinForms, not the UI library. The package
`@cashgear/ui` inside `cashgear-archive` is a different package with the same name.

## Gotchas

Added as they are found, grouped by phase.

### Phase 0

- pnpm 12 refuses a release less than a day old and offers to add it to
  `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. Do not keep that entry: pin the previous
  release instead.
- TypeScript stays on 6.0.x: `typescript-eslint` 8.72 supports `typescript <6.1.0`.
- Commands started in the background may have no network (`static.crates.io` does not resolve).
  Run `cargo fetch` in the foreground first, then build in the background with
  `CARGO_NET_OFFLINE=true`.
- A release desktop build takes about five minutes (LTO, one codegen unit).
- In this environment the Bash tool may be refused writes under `.git/objects`; run git from
  PowerShell. Heredocs holding Arabic text or `|` can fail in Bash: write such files with the
  file tool.
- Tiptap's `configure()` copies option objects deeply: an object passed in (a counter, a cache)
  is not the one the extension uses. Pass a function that returns it.
- A transaction appended to a remote Yjs change (`appendTransaction`) never reaches Yjs in either
  binding: they hold a mutex. Dispatch follow-up changes on their own (the id repair does).
- Every Tiptap editor builds its own `Schema`, so `Node.eq` across editors is always false;
  compare JSON.
- `yrs`: asking for a root type (`get_or_insert_*`) while a transaction is open blocks forever;
  `get_string` on XML text renders formatting as tags (read the delta for plain text). Yjs keeps
  its pending update in the v2 encoding (`applyUpdateV2`).
- `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient` refuses invariant globalization, and 7.1.1 brings
  `System.Security.Cryptography.Pkcs` 9.0.18, which has advisories: pin 10.0.15.
- The WebView2 spike host must start on `about:blank`; navigating it while it loads a start URL
  interrupts Playwright's `goto`.
